#Hello World!

Hi, and welcome to my official blog! I'm Joseph Moore, an author and orator, interested in topics like success/failure, motivation, effort, and more! My inclination in these topics has even culminated in a book, *Vision. Motivation. Action*. This book covers my life story and how I came from a middle-class background and worked hard to eventually become a writer like I am today. Due to the success of this book, which you can buy [here](/buy-book), I am set to go on a book tour around America to share my *vision*, *motivation*, and *actions* with you guys as well as conducting some book signings. I would absolutely love to see you guys there, so if you haven't already, [check](/event-schedule) if I will be in your town, and if so, [book your tickets](/booking) soon! Hope to see you there!
